    "During the first few weeks, we discussed various ways to represent text 📝. One key question was: What should be the basic unit of representation? Words are the fundamental building blocks 🧱.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore different text representation models, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF and word embeddings 🔤➡️🔢. Among these, word embeddings are the most effective in terms of performance. They represent each word as a vector of numbers, where each vector captures the meaning of the word 🧠📊.\n",
    "\n",
    "These numerical representations (or weights) are learned using machine learning models 🤖. We’ll dive deeper into how these vectors are learned in the next lecture 📚.\n",

    "`vocab_size` is calculated as the length of the passed `token_to_id` dictionary. The resulting array should have zeros everywhere but the indices corresponding to the words in the vocabulary where it should have the counts of the words in the sentence. For example, if the sentence is `['fox', 'and', 'deer']` and the vocabulary is `{'fox': 0, 'and': 1, 'deer': 2}`, the resulting array should be `[1, 1, 1]`. If the sentence is `['fox', 'and', 'fox', 'deer']`, the resulting array should be `[2, 1, 1]`."
