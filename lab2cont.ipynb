    "During the first few weeks, we discussed various ways to represent text 📝. One key question was: What should be the basic unit of representation? Words are the fundamental building blocks 🧱.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore different text representation models, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF and word embeddings 🔤➡️🔢. Among these, word embeddings are the most effective in terms of performance. They represent each word as a vector of numbers, where each vector captures the meaning of the word 🧠📊.\n",

    "These numerical representations (or weights) are learned using machine learning models 🤖. We’ll dive deeper into how these vectors are learned in the next lecture 📚.\n",

    "\n",
    "#At the beggining our result indeed included sentence with multiple 'the' but after quick clean it started to match sentences excluding stop-words.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#Another thing worth mentioning is the fact that multiple sentences including the word 'park' twice had different similarity - that might be caused because they include different number of filler words do the similarity differs. example would be, for the query 'park' sentence 'park park I love park' has bigger similarity than 'park park I love park so so much'\n",

    "#Lastly we decided to check if the system finds synonyms using the query \"car\" and k=1000 (so we can check a wide range of sentences. the lowest similarity had a very log sentence that included the word car but that means that our function does not take into addition synonyms like 'vehicle' which could be a significant improvement.\n",

    "## 5. Sentence Embeddings by Averaging Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are a powerful model for representing words and their meaning (in terms of distributional similarity). As we discussed in class, we can use them in a wide variety of tasks with more complex architectures. Word vectors offer a dense vector for each word. What if we wanted to represent a sentence (or a document) based on word vectors. How can we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course, we will see different architectures that take into account the sequence of words (by combining their vectors). A first naive but simple and sometimes (as we are going to see) quite effective approach would be to represent a sentence with an embedding vector that is the average of the word vectors that form the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "So formally, this is what we are aiming for:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Sentence_Embedding} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\text{Word_Embedding}_i\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $N$ is the number of words in a sentence\n",
    "* $\\text{Word_Embedding}_i$ is the word vector for the $i$-th in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "* The embedding vector for the sentence will obviously have the same dimension as the word embedding.\n",
    "* This representation ignores the word order (like bag-of-words). During the course we will see how we can overcome this limitation by using sequence models."
