    "During the first few weeks, we discussed various ways to represent text 📝. One key question was: What should be the basic unit of representation? Words are the fundamental building blocks 🧱.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore different text representation models, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF and word embeddings 🔤➡️🔢. Among these, word embeddings are the most effective in terms of performance. They represent each word as a vector of numbers, where each vector captures the meaning of the word 🧠📊.\n",
    "\n",
    "These numerical representations (or weights) are learned using machine learning models 🤖. We’ll dive deeper into how these vectors are learned in the next lecture 📚.\n",

    "`vocab_size` is calculated as the length of the passed `token_to_id` dictionary. The resulting array should have zeros everywhere but the indices corresponding to the words in the vocabulary where it should have the counts of the words in the sentence. For example, if the sentence is `['fox', 'and', 'deer']` and the vocabulary is `{'fox': 0, 'and': 1, 'deer': 2}`, the resulting array should be `[1, 1, 1]`. If the sentence is `['fox', 'and', 'fox', 'deer']`, the resulting array should be `[2, 1, 1]`."

    "In the animal similarity picture, the words \"cat\" and \"dog\" are the most similar, which makes sense because they often appear together as pets. \"Lion\" and \"tiger\" also show strong similarity because they are both big wild cats. \"Wolf\" is somewhere in between, linking to both dogs and wild animals since it's a relative of the dog but also a predator. \"Horse\" is a bit different from the rest, but still shares some connection with \"cat\" and \"dog\", likely because all three are mentioned in contexts like farms or animal care. The least similar pairs are \"horse\" with \"wolf\" and \"tiger\", showing that those animals don’t often appear in the same kind of discussions."

    "In the plot with words about places to live, \"town\" and \"village\" are the most similar, and \"city\" is also very close to \"town\", which makes sense because they describe different sizes of populated areas. \"Suburb\" is more related to \"city\" and \"town\" than to \"country\", reflecting how suburbs are closer to urban areas and not the countryside. \"Metropolis\" sounds like it should match \"city\", but it’s not as close as expected, possibly because people use it in more dramatic or fictional contexts. \"Country\" is the least connected to the others, probably because the word has two meanings—rural area and nation—which can confuse the model."

Overall, the model groups the foods based on cuisine and how they are typically eaten—whether they’re fast food or part of specific cultural dishes."

    "## 5. Sentence Embeddings by Averaging Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are a powerful model for representing words and their meaning (in terms of distributional similarity). As we discussed in class, we can use them in a wide variety of tasks with more complex architectures. Word vectors offer a dense vector for each word. What if we wanted to represent a sentence (or a document) based on word vectors. How can we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course, we will see different architectures that take into account the sequence of words (by combining their vectors). A first naive but simple and sometimes (as we are going to see) quite effective approach would be to represent a sentence with an embedding vector that is the average of the word vectors that form the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "So formally, this is what we are aiming for:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Sentence_Embedding} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\text{Word_Embedding}_i\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $N$ is the number of words in a sentence\n",
    "* $\\text{Word_Embedding}_i$ is the word vector for the $i$-th in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "* The embedding vector for the sentence will obviously have the same dimension as the word embedding.\n",
    "* This representation ignores the word order (like bag-of-words). During the course we will see how we can overcome this limitation by using sequence models."
