    "During the first few weeks, we discussed various ways to represent text 📝. One key question was: What should be the basic unit of representation? Words are the fundamental building blocks 🧱.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore different text representation models, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF and word embeddings 🔤➡️🔢. Among these, word embeddings are the most effective in terms of performance. They represent each word as a vector of numbers, where each vector captures the meaning of the word 🧠📊.\n",

The bag-of-words representation is a simple and effective way to represent text data.

As we discussed in class, we can use them in a wide variety of tasks with more complex architectures. Word vectors offer a dense vector for each word. What if we wanted to represent a sentence (or a document) based on word vectors. How can we do that?\n",

    "(3p) In this exercise you will revisit your implementation of the cosine similarity. Generalize it so that it can accept two arrays containing two sets of vectors (first one containing $M$ vectors and the second one $N$ vectors). Compute the cosine similarity between each pair of vectors coming from the two sets. The result should be an array of size $M x N$.\n",
